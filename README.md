UnmaskingTrees is a method for tabular data generation and imputation. It's an order-agnostic autoregressive diffusion model, wherein a training dataset is constructed by incrementally masking features in random order. Per-feature gradient-boosted trees are then trained to unmask each feature. Read more about it in my [blog post](https://calvinmccarter.substack.com/p/unmasking-trees-for-tabular-data)!

To better model conditional distributions which are multi-modal ("modal" as in "modes", not as in "modalities"), we by default discretize continuous features into `n_bins` bins. You can customize this, via the `quantize_cols` parameter in the `fit` method. Provide a list of length `n_dims`, with values in `('continuous', 'categorical', 'integer')`. Given `categorical` it skips quantization of that feature; given `integer` it only quantizes if the number of unique values > `n_bins`.

## Installation 

### Installation from PyPI
```
pip install utrees
```

### Installation from source
After cloning this repo, install the dependencies on the command-line, then install utrees:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pytest
```

## Usage

Check out [this notebook](https://github.com/calvinmccarter/unmasking-trees/blob/master/moons-demo.ipynb) with the Two Moons example, or [this one](https://github.com/calvinmccarter/unmasking-trees/blob/master/iris-demo.ipynb) with the Iris dataset.

### Synthetic data generation

You can fit `utrees.UnmaskingTrees` the way you would an sklearn model, with the added option that you can call `fit` with `quantize_cols`, a list to specify which columns are continuous (and therefore need to be discretized). By default, all columns are assumed to contain continuous features.

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons
from utrees import UnmaskingTrees
data, labels = make_moons((100, 100), shuffle=False, noise=0.1, random_state=123)  # size (200, 2)
utree = UnmaskingTrees().fit(data)
```

Then, you can generate new data:

```
newdata = utree.generate(n_generate=123)  # size (123, 2)
```

### Missing data imputation

You can fit your `UnmaskingTrees` model on data with missing elements, provided as `np.nan`. You can then impute the missing values, potentially with multiple imputations per missing element. Given an array of `(n_samples, n_dims)`, you will get back an array of size `(n_impute, n_samples, n_dims)`, where the NaNs have been replaced while the others are unchanged.

```
data4impute = data.copy()
data4impute[:, 1] = np.nan
X=np.concatenate([data, data4impute], axis=0)  # size (400, 2)
utree = UnmaskingTrees().fit(X)                                                                                    
imputeddata = utree.impute(n_impute=5)  # size (5, 400, 2)
```

You can also provide a totally new dataset to be imputed, so the model performs imputation without retraining:

```
utree = UnmaskingTrees().fit(data)                                                                                    
imputeddata = utree.impute(n_impute=5, X=data4impute)  # size (5, 200, 2)
```

### Hyperparameters

- n_bins: Number of bins for discretizing continuous features.
- duplicate_K: Number of random masking orders per actual sample. The training dataset will be of size `(n_samples * n_dims * duplicate_K, n_dims)`.
- top_p: Nucleus sampling parameter for inference.
- xgboost_kwargs: dict to pass to XGBClassifier.
- strategy: how to quantize continuous features ('kdiquantile', 'quantile', 'uniform', or 'kmeans').
- random_state: controls randomness.
